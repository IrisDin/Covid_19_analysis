# How to run our project:


If there is anything we need to do to set up your project, like install libraries or how to download your data (if you did not submit it), give us instructions for how to do so.

Anything else we need to know about running your project!
Your instructions should be detailed enough that your mentor can run your code to reproduce any of the results in your report. You can assume the reader of your instructions is familiar with programming environments in Python and have read your report. You should not assume your mentor will spend time “figuring out” how to run your project with anything outside of your instructions so make sure your instructions are clear and unambiguous.

**To begin with, we implement new libraries : datetime, plotly and they should be installed before using. For this project, we use pandas, datetime, matplotlib, and plotly library and all of them should be imported before executeing our python file. For the dataset we use, the original datasdet is from kaggle website and we upload these dataset on the github so they can be directly read in python by read.csv("url link"). For the vusilization in this file, the plotly library will help to present the interactive plot in a web through python-built web applications using Dash. For the non-interactive visulization, we save the chart in local directory to observe.**
