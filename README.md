**This is a project that use python to make analysis about COVID-19 Vaccination, Cases, and Deaths Worldwide. You can check more details on our project report, method.py, project_notebook.ipynb and the interactive testing visualizations with the attached Tableau workbook.**


# How to run our project üèÉ:

**To run our project, the necessary library/package need to be imported and installed in local python environment are pandas, matplotlib, plotly, scipy and math.**

**The datasets we use is from kaggle website and you can download these files from dataset reference section below. We also upload these dataset on our github repository
for direct usage.**

**For the visualizations in the method.py, the plotly library will help to present the interactive plot in a web through python-built web applications using Dash. For the non-interactive visualizations, we save the chart in local directory to observe. We also put our code in a jupyter notebook called project_notebook.ipynb which allow people to interact with each chart in an easier and more direct way. We also provide extra testing interactive visualizations through Tableau Software. You can download the [Tableau Desktop](https://www.tableau.com/) to access and interact with our visualizations. If you can not access to Tableau license, we also upload the static screenshots on the Tableau test visualization folder for reference.**
