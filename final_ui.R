            We think we can change the distribution of the missing value after filtering and sorting the dataset by using R. Also, another potential problem with the dataset is that there are over 70000 rows of the dataset which contain all different countriesâ€™ vaccination information. This is a large dataset that might be hard to process and filter the core information and pattern we want.
            The potential solution we came up with is that we need to further explore our research question and drop the information or data we do not need. We need to clean and condense our dataset in order to get better visualization. In addition, we think it is necessary for us to add more features to the dataset for better analysis. For example, merging the vaccine type feature can help 
            us better visualize the usage for different brandsâ€™ vaccination like Pfizer or Moderna in different areas.",style = "font-size:20px;")

takes the pandemic most seriously. As its nearby country, India also took immediate actions to fight against the coronavirus. The spreadout of the pandemic is extremly fast throughout the world. Countries with large population density are more able to be infected and
the U.S. has also been influenced severely so it has a relative high vaccinated population as well.", style = "font-size:20px;"),

              vaccinations in general. Still, due to the gradual loose policy indifferent region, seems like the number of people getting vaccinated is decreasing. Especially in the United States, for instance, wearing a mask is become optional in some regions, and even
